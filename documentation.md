#   Project Documentation: Personal Portfolio Website

##  Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and provide contact information. It is a multi-page website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site aims to be responsive, providing a good user experience across various devices.

The website includes the following pages:

-   **Home:** The main entry point, providing an introduction, a brief personal summary, and links to other sections.
-   **About:** Detailed information about my background, education, skills, and experience.
-   **Projects:** A showcase of my projects with descriptions and links (where applicable).
-   **Contact:** A page with contact information and a form for visitors to send messages.

##  Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** Used for the semantic structure of all web pages.  It provides the necessary elements for text, images, links, and form inputs.
-   **CSS3:** Used for the styling and visual presentation of the website. This includes layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design to ensure compatibility across different screen sizes.
-   **JavaScript:** Used to add client-side interactivity to the website.  Currently, it handles form validation on the contact page and some basic UI enhancements.  It can be expanded for more complex interactions.
